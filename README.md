# ADBDump
Command line tool written in Go to monitor the connection between android adb and and a android device.

This is a very early stage in development. It kinda works but do not expect too much. ***As always before you run anything with sudo, have a look a the code.***

Install with 
  
    go get -v  -u  github.com/HaBaLeS/ADBDump

if $GOPATH/bin is in your PATH run it with 

    sudo ADBDump

or 

    sudo ADBDump -h for Options
